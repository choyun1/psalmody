"""Find the page for each Sunday and feast on lectionary.episcopalchurch.org, for links to it.

    python tools/lectionary_links.py            # read the site's month pages, update the table
    python tools/lectionary_links.py 2025 2028  # the months from Advent 2025 to the end of 2028

The site gives each day's page a number (lectionary-post/89 is Proper 21, Year A), which can only be
found on its month pages (lectionary.episcopalchurch.org/2026/9). This reads them, matches each Sunday
and feast to the day this psalter's lectionary has for that date, and keeps the numbers in
reference/lectionary_links.csv, saving after each month (so stopping it keeps what it found). One
three-year cycle is enough, since the same page serves the same day every third year. The site keeps
no months before December 2025, so by default this reads from Advent last year to the end of the
year after next, which covers Years A, B and C. A day still missing links to its month's calendar
instead. Run it again if the site changes.
